[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mmawk[0m  is  an  interpreter  for  the AWK Programming Language.  The AWK language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms.[m
       [1mmawk[0m is a [4mnew[24m [4mawk[24m meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, [4mThe[24m [4mAWK[24m [4mProgramming[24m [4mLanguage,[24m Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988 (hereafter referred to as  the  AWK  book.)[m
       [1mmawk[0m conforms to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and [1mmawk[0m provides a small number of extensions.[m
[m
       An AWK program is a sequence of [4mpattern[24m [4m{action}[24m pairs and function definitions.  Short programs are entered on the command line usually enclosed in ' ' to avoid shell interpretation.  Longer programs can be[m
       read in from a file with the -f option.  Data  input is read from the list of files on the command line or from standard input when the list is empty.  The input is broken into records as determined  by  the[m
       record separator variable, [1mRS[0m.  Initially, [1mRS[0m = “\n” and records are synonymous with lines.  Each record is compared against each [4mpattern[24m and if it matches, the program text for [4m{action}[24m is executed.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       -[1mF[0m [4mvalue[24m       sets the field separator, [1mFS[0m, to [4mvalue[24m.[m
[m
       -[1mf[0m [4mfile[24m        Program text is read from [4mfile[24m instead of from the command line.  Multiple [1m-f[0m options are allowed.[m
[m
       -[1mv[0m [4mvar=value[24m   assigns [4mvalue[24m to program variable [4mvar[24m.[m
[m
       --             indicates the unambiguous end of options.[m
[m
       The above options will be available with any POSIX compatible implementation of AWK.  Implementation specific options are prefaced with [1m-W[0m.  [1mmawk[0m provides these:[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m dump        writes an assembler like listing of the internal representation of the program to stdout and exits 0 (on successful compilation).[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m exec [4mfile[24m   Program text is read from [4mfile[24m and this is the last option.[m
[m
                      This  is  a useful alternative to -[1mf[0m on systems that support the [1m#![0m  “magic number” convention for executable scripts.  Those implicitly pass the pathname of the script itself as the final pa‐[m
                      rameter, and expect no more than one “-” option on the [1m#![0m line.  Because [1mmawk[0m can combine multiple -[1mW[0m options separated by commas, you can use this option  when  an  additional  -[1mW[0m  option  is[m
                      needed.[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m help        prints a usage message to stderr and exits (same as “-[1mW[0m usage”).[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m interactive sets unbuffered writes to stdout and line buffered reads from stdin.  Records from stdin are lines regardless of the value of [1mRS[0m.[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m posix_space forces [1mmawk[0m not to consider '\n' to be space.[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m random=[4mnum[24m  calls [1msrand[0m with the given parameter (and overrides the auto-seeding behavior).[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m sprintf=[4mnum[24m adjusts the size of [1mmawk[0m's internal sprintf buffer to [4mnum[24m bytes.  More than rare use of this option indicates [1mmawk[0m should be recompiled.[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m usage       prints a usage message to stderr and exits (same as “-[1mW[0m help”).[m
[m
       -[1mW[0m version     [1mmawk[0m writes its version and copyright to stdout and compiled limits to stderr and exits 0.[m
[m
       [1mmawk[0m accepts abbreviations for any of these options, e.g., “-[1mW[0m v” and “-[1mW[0mv” both tell [1mmawk[0m to show its version.[m
[m
       [1mmawk[0m  allows  multiple  [1m-W[0m options to be combined by separating the options with commas, e.g., -Wsprint=2000,posix.  This is useful for executable [1m#![0m  “magic number” invocations in which only one argument is[m
       supported, e.g., -[1mWinteractive,exec[0m.[m
